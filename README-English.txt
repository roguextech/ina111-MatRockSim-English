MatRockSim
Matlab Rocket Flight Simulator

6 degrees of freedom rocket flight simulator. Simulate flight in a horizontal coordinate system.

Run
Execute with the following command in the MatRockSim folder with Matlab / Octave.

MatRockSim
parameter settings
Change the contents of the params.m file
Change drag coefficient by modifying the aerodynamics / cd_Rocket.m file
Future Works
Time change of moment of inertia. (Cooperation between thrust and Xdot, etc.)
Pressure center transition (Barrowman method ??, Mach number-dependent aerodynamic moment coefficient ??)
Corresponds to changes in the wind in the sky
Tip off when leaving the launcher
Navigation guidance, attitude control, sequence control
How to use Simulink
Start Matlab and turn Initialize.m in the command window

Start Initiallize simulink_MatRockSim.slx and simulate on Simulink.
